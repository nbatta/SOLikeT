# Bringing a new likelihood into SOLikeT

The following lays out what needs to be done to bring a new likelihood (e.g., **newlike**)
into the **soliket** framework.  Note that at present not all of these have yet been done
as stated below for the currently implemented likelihoods, but this will come.

* Is **newlike** Gaussian or Poisson?  If so, great; if not, then we need to do some
prep work to implement a generic version of the new likelihood form 
into **SOLikeT**, alongside `GaussianLikelihood` and `PoissonLikelihood`.

* Test **newlike** *in situ*:
    * Is there a minimal installation procedure available for the original likelihood? 
      (i.e., can install & use likelihood without heavy dependencies?) 
    * Is there a minimal test suite for the orignal implementation?  A bare minimum test is a demo
    `test_newlike.yaml` file specifying a test model, and corresponding
    `test_newlike.py` test file that loads that model and compares the computed likelihood to a fiducial value.

* Port **newlike** into **soliket**:
    * Put `test_newlike.yaml` and `test_newlike.py` files into `soliket/tests`.  These should be the same 
    as the original versions of these files, with the sole exception that paths to the referenced likelihoods
    should be `soliket.newlike` instead of the original paths.  When these tests pass,
    then we know the likelihood is correctly implemented.
    * Create a submodule for the new likelihood in `soliket/newliket`, and copy the original code over into this.

* Once ported code passes tests, refactor **newlike** to follow **soliket** conventions:
    * Rewrite likelihood code so as to inherit from `GaussianLikelihood`, implementing `_get_data()`, `_get_cov()`,
    `_get_theory()` methods, etc.
    * Also, if there is substantial data to be used by the likelihood, have it also extend 
    `_InstallableLikelihood` (see `soliket.mflike` and `soliket.lensing` for examples).
    * Factor out all calculations necessary to compute the "theory vector" into separate standalone
    `Theory` objects (current example of this is the `Foreground` object in `soliket.mflike`.)


Development regarding **newlike** in the soliket repository should either happen in a branch named `dev-newlike`.  
Submit a pull request and request review to merge to master.
